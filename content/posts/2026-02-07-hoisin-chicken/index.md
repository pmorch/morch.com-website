*5-6 servings / 45 minutes*

| | |
|---|---|
| 600 g chicken thighs | A little neutral oil |
| 3 cloves garlic | ~100 ml soy sauce |
| ~2 thumbs ginger | 75 g cashew nuts |
| 2 tbsp five-spice | 200 g hoisin sauce |
| 2 tbsp sesame seeds | 200 ml water + 1 bouillon cube |
| 2 tbsp sesame oil | |
| ~100 ml teriyaki or oyster sauce | **For serving** |
| Salt | Cooked rice |
| 1 broccoli (approx. 300–400 g) | 1 handful fresh coriander |
| 1 bunch spring onions | 1 lime |
| 2-3 tbsp brown sugar | |

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (convection/fan). Cut the chicken thighs into rough chunks. Place them in a bowl, and press the garlic over them with a garlic press, and add the finely diced ginger. Sprinkle with five-spice, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and salt, and toss everything together. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized florets. Roughly slice the spring onions.

2. Spread the chicken, broccoli, and spring onions (save some for serving) in an oven-proof dish. Sprinkle with the brown sugar, and drizzle with oil and soy sauce. Bake in the hot oven for 10 minutes. Add the cashew nuts, hoisin sauce, teriyaki/oyster sauce, and the water with the dissolved bouillon cube, and bake for a further 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the broccoli florets are tender and al dente.

3. Serve in deep plates, preferably with cooked rice. Sprinkle the remaining spring onions and picked coriander over the top, and serve with lime wedges.

**Tip:** If you want extra vegetables, try pak choy, asparagus, carrots, or pointed cabbage — and skip the rice!
