Really cool list of [34 Cleverly Designed Inventions](http://nedhardy.com/2011/03/10/34-cleverly-designed-inventions/). I especially liked the USB connector, the stair case drawers, and the crawling lamp on the wall.

Thanks to the [Userfocus Usability Newsletter](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/newsletter/sep2011.html) for the link. The site also has lovely [32 Pictures To Help You Appreciate The Awesomeness Of Nature](http://nedhardy.com/2010/10/12/32-pictures-to-help-you-appreciate-the-awesomeness-of-nature/) but I better let you go now :-).
