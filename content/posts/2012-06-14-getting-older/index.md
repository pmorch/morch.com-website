The other day, I was cooking, and it was time to set the table.

Suddenly I found myself standing in the storage/utility room. And I had no idea why I was there. "Peter, you need to set the table! Get back on track!" - I told myself.

So I went back into the kitchen. Looked at the table: What was missing? Ah, drinks. OK, glasses, plastic cup for my daughter, pitcher of water - check. "Hey, I'd like a Coke", so I opened the fridge. No Cokes. Should probably put some in the fridge for next time I want a Coke. I went to the utility room, and suddenly it hit me: _That_ is what I was doing in the storage room! Getting Cokes for the fridge!

Man, I think I'm... What was it? ... Yes, I'm getting older!
