](http://www.morch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gpsSurveillance.jpg)So now here in Copenhagen, [apparently](http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE1486684/ny-gps-teknologi-overhaler-betalingsringen/) traffic experts are suggesting that instead of a congestion charge similar to [London's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_congestion_charge), in the future we should have a GPS receiver in our cars that transmits our position continuously to the tax authorities. And I'm sure that somebody (who won't be re-elected and who therefore can't be held accountable) will declare that this is for the sole purpose of [Congestion Charging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing). And it wouldn't surprise me if it becomes the law.

Yeah, right. Now I ask you, dear reader: How long do you think it'll be before this is also used to find the mythical pedophile nazi-terrorists  too? I guess that's ok too, right? But how long before they dig in and allow this to be used by the police to find:



* Illegal parking
* Speeding
* People collecting social benefits they shouldn't be collecting (Danish: "Sociale Bedragere")
* People they want to check up on and keep track of, just for good measure.
* Continuously monitor who associates with conspicuous people, a.k.a before-mentioned pedophile nazi-terrorists.
* Keeping lists of who participated in which public demonstrations, just for good measure.

And how long before the tabloid press start revealing that reality-star du-jour has spent the night at another reality-star du-jour?

This is a slippery slope. Here in Denmark, we have a "child pornography filter". Originally that was for child pornography _only_. But it evolved into blocking [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) (because it was proven that pirates are terrorists?), other file-sharing sites and drug spam sites. Its well on its way to being turned into a general purpose [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act)-like censorship filter.

And make no mistake. This is ideal for putting in a database: Who-was-where-when.

Imagine that Hitler gained power today, and measures like these were in place: "Ah, the opponents (I'm sure he'd call them terrorists) met at Freedom Lane nr 17 on Oct 17 at 19.00. Arrest anyone who parked within 15min/200m from this time/place".

I am scared, actually. Primarily that most people don't give a damn. Because they think they haven't got anything to hide.
