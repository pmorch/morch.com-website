Isn't this great?


<blockquote>If you define "church" as an organization that teaches a  specific doctrine in a very specific way, and "state" as the institution  which is empowered to create and implement the laws which govern your  people, it is of benefit for these elements to be separated.

If you define "spirituality" as the sum total of your cultural values  and your most sacred beliefs, and "politics" as the process by which  you select the people who will write and pass laws, as well as the  method by which laws are adopted, then it is not of benefit for these  elements to be separated.

It is not the function of the state to promulgate specific religious  doctrines. It is therefore not beneficial for a particular church or  religion to exert its influence on the mechanisms by which a state  governs. No church or religion speaks for the conscience of all of the  people, and such influence would thus be unfair to those who do not  agree with the doctrines and point of view of the church or religion in  question.

Yet it would be beneficial for your cultural values and your most  sacred beliefs to influence the process by which you decide who shall  propose laws, and how they shall be adopted, because each individual  making that choice is presumed to be, and is asked to be, voting his or  her conscience.
