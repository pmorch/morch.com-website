I'd like to recommend an Android App for seeing the Sun's path in Augmented Reality (AR): [Sun Surveyor](http://www.sunsurveyor.com/). There is also [Sun Seeker](http://ajnaware.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/sun-seeker-seeing-the-light-with-augmented-reality/#comment-584) for iPhone/iOS, which I haven't tried since I don't have an iPhone.

We're out looking for a house to buy, and for me getting the afternoon and evening sun on the terrace during summer is so incredibly important. This way, I don't have to take the real-estate agent's word for where the sun goes down in the summer and whether the trees will create shade on the terrace. I can check it myself. Über-cool!

The graphics are laid out on top of my phone's camera image, so given the image to the right I can see that on July 9th (almost mid-summer) the sun clears the wall just after 7pm before it goes down at 8:52pm.  A little before that it will be obstructed by the wall in the background though. All visible on one screen.

I guess this could be handy for photographers too, but for buying a house this is indispensable. What surprises me is how all the real-estate agents that I've shown it to were blown away by it (or so they pretended :-)) but had never seen or heard about something like that before.

Have fun with it!
