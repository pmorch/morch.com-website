Honestly, I don't understand how somebody can prefer PDF to HTML for on-screen viewing. Really? That is possible? If you're one of them, can you help me understand?

<!-- more -->There is no doubt that PDF is superior, if you're going to _print_ the document, but if you're going to _read it on-screen_, I don't even know where to begin listing why PDF sucks. But I'll try. My top gripes are:



* It is a different environment. My web browser buttons, extensions, history don't work. Selecting text works differently. Searching works differently. Right-clicking, cut'n'paste all work differently. It's a completely different environment from that page I came from. Why?
* I'm served a "individual page metaphor", rather than a "continuous page" one. Why do I have to see headers and footers for what would be separate pages if I were to print it?
* PDF files tend to misbehave on Ubuntu/Linux. That is likely not a problem for you.

I realize that I'm passionate and emotional about this issue. So I googled "[pdf usability studies](http://www.google.com/search?q=pdf+usability+studies)". Yeah, right. Thankfully the first relevant hit was [PDF: Unfit for Human Consumption (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox on useit.com)](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030714.html). I don't always agree with Jakob Nielsen (I mean [http://www.useit.com](http://www.useit.com) is perhaps usable, but man is it ugly!) Mostly, though I got links to PDF files containing the conclusions of usability studies on all sorts of other things. So not all usability experts seem to hate PDF files. :-( On the other side of the coin, way down in the list was [PDF usability: Debate and reality on acrobatusers.com](http://acrobatusers.com/articles/2006/11/usability_debate). I guess it isn't surprising that somebody on acrobatusers.com likes PDF files! ;-)

Jakob Nielsen mentions usability studies and research and quotes from some of them, but I'm wondering if there is other, independent studies or research - not loud opinions like this one! Of course I'm hoping for links that confirm my point of view, but really I'd like to know what "people" think.
